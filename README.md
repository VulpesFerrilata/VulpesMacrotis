👋 Hi, I’m Lucy

I’m new to web development and learning on the job. I have many years experience of writing web content, and this is my first jump to the more technical side. I'm particularly interested in spatial development and creating accessible content.

🌱 I’m currently learning C#, .NET, Entity Framework and a crazy amount of stuff.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects to help me learn.
